# agrv
- to import sys library to agrv (argumant varaiable) use below lines in your pythopn script
`from sys import argv`   
`script, first, second, third, fourth = argv`
- when you run your python script in terminal use: `python3.7 "your file name".py "variable1" "variable2" ... `
- remember to keep the number of variables same as the number of variables defined in `script, first, second, third, fourth = argv` => here, we defined four variables
- you can replace any four variable in your python script argument
  - for example:
    `python3.7 syntax_argument.py apple orange peach grape`
