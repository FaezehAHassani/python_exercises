# modules, classes and objects
- in terminal
>>> mystuff = {'apple': "I AM APPLES!"}
>>> print(mystuff['apple'])

print(mystuff.tangerine)

- objects are like import

- class is a blueprint that create an object and then you assign a variable to the object
- "instantiate" means to create an object from a class
- self.name makes an instance attribute otherwise only name may considered as a local variable
